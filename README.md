# omniapp-concept project



*note to self
git stashing and poping during check is not worh it, as we can possible stash
then try to pop, see conflict and try to abort stash pop with "git reset --merge"
and that will remove anything already staged (got into that trap myself)

It seems much reasonable to just run tests on all changes in working dir
